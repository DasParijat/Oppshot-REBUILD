Oppshot REBUILD

This game is a remake of my Scratch game by the same name. 
Oppshot is a game that requires 2 people to play on the same computer 
(Or you just control both sides alone)
Shoot down all 3 castles on the opposite side to win. Once someone 
wins the game ends itself.
(Or you just control both sides alone)
WASD KEYS to move Blue
ARROW KEYS to move Red

Oppshot is based off an elementary gym game "Castle Ball" (hence why the circles are called castles)

Since this is my first game on Godot, Oppshot REBUILD allows me to experiment and learn it's many
features.
